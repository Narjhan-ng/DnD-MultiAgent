# D&D 5e Basic Rules - Essential Reference

## Combat Rules

### Initiative
At the start of combat, every participant rolls initiative by making a Dexterity check. The DM ranks the combatants from highest to lowest initiative roll. This is the order in which they act during each round.

### Actions in Combat
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. The most common actions are:

**Attack**: Make one melee or ranged attack with your weapon.
**Cast a Spell**: Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action.
**Dash**: You gain extra movement equal to your speed for the current turn.
**Disengage**: Your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
**Dodge**: Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage.
**Help**: You aid a creature within 5 feet in their next ability check or attack roll.
**Hide**: Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to attempt to hide.
**Ready**: You prepare an action to trigger in response to a specified circumstance.

### Attack Rolls
When you make an attack, you roll a d20 and add modifiers:
- Attack Roll = d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus (if proficient)
- If the total equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits

### Damage Rolls
When you hit with an attack, you roll damage based on your weapon:
- Melee weapon attacks add your Strength modifier to damage
- Ranged weapon attacks add your Dexterity modifier to damage
- Spell attacks follow the spell's description

### Critical Hits
When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, you score a critical hit. Roll all damage dice twice and add them together, then add relevant modifiers.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
**Advantage**: Roll two d20s and use the higher roll
**Disadvantage**: Roll two d20s and use the lower roll

Situations granting advantage:
- Attacking an enemy that can't see you
- Attacking a prone enemy from within 5 feet
- Attacking a paralyzed or restrained enemy

Situations imposing disadvantage:
- Attacking while prone
- Attacking an enemy you can't see
- Attacking beyond a ranged weapon's normal range

## Grappling

### Grappling Rules
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple.

**Requirements**:
- Target must be no more than one size larger than you
- You must have at least one free hand

**Making a Grapple**:
- Make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
- If you succeed, the target is grappled
- The grappled condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated or if an effect removes the target from reach

**Effects of Grappling**:
- The grappled creature's speed becomes 0
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated
- Moving a grappled creature: Your speed is halved unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you

**Escaping a Grapple**:
- Use your action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the grappler's Strength (Athletics) check
- Success means you escape and are no longer grappled

## Spellcasting

### Casting a Spell
Each spell has a casting time, range, duration, and components required to cast it.

**Casting Time**:
- Most spells require 1 action to cast
- Some spells require a bonus action, reaction, or longer (minutes/hours)

**Spell Components**:
- **V (Verbal)**: You must speak in a clear voice
- **S (Somatic)**: You must gesture freely with at least one hand
- **M (Material)**: You must have specific materials in hand

**Concentration**:
- Some spells require concentration to maintain
- You can only concentrate on one spell at a time
- Taking damage requires a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 or half damage, whichever is higher) to maintain concentration
- Casting another concentration spell ends the previous one

### Spell Attack Rolls
Some spells require an attack roll:
- Spell Attack = d20 + spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus

### Spell Save DCs
Some spells require the target to make a saving throw:
- Spell Save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier + proficiency bonus

## Common Spells

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
