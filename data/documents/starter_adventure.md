# The Forgotten Crypt
*A D&D 5e Adventure for 3-5 Characters of 1st Level*

## Adventure Overview

The village of Greenhollow has been plagued by strange disappearances. Three villagers have vanished in the past week, all near the old ruins at the edge of the Whispering Woods. The local priest discovered an ancient crypt entrance beneath the ruins, sealed for centuries but now mysteriously opened. The adventurers are hired to investigate the crypt and rescue any survivors.

**Adventure Hooks**:
- The innkeeper's daughter, Elara, went missing yesterday. He offers 50 gold pieces for her safe return.
- A traveling merchant was attacked near the ruins. He escaped but his two guards vanished. He offers 100 gold and trade discounts.
- The village priest suspects undead activity and asks the heroes to cleanse the crypt for the good of the community.

## Part 1: The Crypt Entrance

### Scene 1: The Ruined Chapel
*Outdoor, daytime*

The adventurers arrive at the ruins of an ancient chapel, now overgrown with vines and moss. Stone pillars lie toppled, and a gaping hole in the floor reveals stone steps descending into darkness.

**What the Players See**:
- Weathered stone walls covered in ivy
- A broken altar dedicated to a forgotten god
- Fresh tracks leading down the stairs (goblins)
- Disturbed earth around the entrance

**Investigation (DC 12)**: The tracks belong to small humanoids, likely goblins, made within the past day.

**Perception (DC 14)**: Faint sounds of movement and whispered voices echo from below.

### Scene 2: Descending the Stairs
The stone stairs descend 30 feet underground. The air grows cold and damp. At the bottom, a stone corridor extends into darkness.

**Trap - Loose Step** (15 feet down):
- **Perception DC 13** to spot the loose stone
- Stepping on it triggers a collapse
- **Dexterity Save DC 12** or fall 15 feet, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and landing prone
- Can be disarmed with thieves' tools (DC 10)

## Part 2: The Crypt Levels

### Room 1: The Entry Hall
*30 feet by 20 feet, stone walls, dusty floor*

### Room 3: The Goblin Den (North Door from Room 1)
*L-shaped room, 30 feet by 25 feet*

**Description**:
This chamber has been converted into a crude living space. Bedrolls, stolen supplies, and gnawed bones are scattered about. The smell is terrible. Elara, the innkeeper's daughter, is tied up in the corner, unconscious but alive.

**Enemies**:

### Room 4: The Collapsed Chamber (East from Room 2)
*Partially collapsed, 20 feet by 15 feet*

**Description**:
The ceiling has partially collapsed here. Rubble blocks most of the room, but a narrow gap leads to a small alcove.

*Large rectangular room, 40 feet by 30 feet, 15-foot ceiling*

**Description**:
